Hello, we recently created README file to update you on every step of our project <3
Programming Language:
We are using Swift as the source programming language for this project.
Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop an interpreter that translates Swift code into Java code. This interpreter will allow developers to easily convert Swift code into Java, simplifying the process of transitioning between the two languages. is this good?
