Swift to Java Interpreter:

The Swift to Java Interpreter is a tool designed to convert Swift source code into equivalent Java code. This interpreter automates the translation process, simplifies the process of transitioning between the two languages ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and consistency, making it ideal for developers working in cross-platform environments or migrating Swift projects to Java-based systems. 

Team Members and Roles:

Liliana Giguashvili - Team Leader
Responsible for overseeing project development, managing tasks, and ensuring timely delivery.

Toma Diasamidze - Developer
Focuses on the core functionality of the interpreter and ensures accurate language translation.

Luka Kurtauli - Developer
Focuses on the core functionality of the interpreter and works on optimizing performance.

Elene Orjonikidze - Developer
Responsible for testing the interpreter and implementing additional features to improve user experience.

Algorithms Collection:

This repository contains implementations of basic algorithms, including sum of numbers, factorial, GCD, reversing numbers, and more. Each algorithm is provided in both Swift and Java, with clear examples and explanations. The algorithms are documented in the Algorithms.txt file.

Project Status:

The Swift to Java Interpreter is fully functional, offering an efficient and user-friendly solution for converting Swift code to Java. It has been thoroughly tested to ensure accuracy and reliability.
